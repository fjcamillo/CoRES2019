    "<i>a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs.</i>\n",
    "~Dr. Robert Hecht-Nielsen\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs are processing devices (algorithms or actual hardware) that are loosely modeled after the neuronal structure of the mamalian cerebral cortex but on much smaller scales. A large ANN might have hundreds or thousands of processor units, whereas a mamalian brain has billions of neurons with a corresponding increase in magnitude of their overall interaction and emergent behavior. Although ANN researchers are generally not concerned with whether their networks accurately resemble biological systems, some have. For example, researchers have accurately simulated the function of the retina and modeled the eye rather well."
